# TypeScript Programming Questions by Sir Zia

This repository contains solutions to 45 TypeScript programming questions by Sir Zia. Each question is fully solved, with TypeScript source code and corresponding JavaScript code provided. The repository is organized to help you understand TypeScript concepts and their practical applications.

I am learning these concepts at [GIAIC (Governor Sindh Initiative for Cloud-Applied Generative AI)](https://giaic.edu.pk).

## Repository Structure

- **`getting-started-exercises`**: Contains questions 1 to 45, each in its own folder.
  - **Question 1**: Installation and setup instructions.
  - **Question Folders**: Each folder corresponds to a specific question and includes:
    - `source.ts`: TypeScript source code.
    - `transpiled.js`: Transpiled JavaScript code.

- **`tsconfig.json`**: TypeScript configuration file, created using `tsc --init`.
- **`package.json`**: Node.js package file, created using `npm init -y`.

## Running the Code

To run the TypeScript code for any question:

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   Open Command Prompt and navigate to the repository folder, then run:
   ```cmd
   npm install
   ```

2. **Transpile TypeScript to JavaScript**:
   Navigate to the specific question's folder and run:
   ```cmd
   tsc fileName.ts
   ```

3. **Run the JavaScript Code**:
   After transpiling, run:
   ```cmd
   node fileName.js
   ```
